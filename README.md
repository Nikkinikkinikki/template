# Temporary Personal Virtual Machine

Welcome to your personal virtual machine personalvm00356 :D

These are designed to enable innovation by removing 
centralised management overhead.

## Granting Access

To grant access to another user simply run:

    groupmems -g users -a unikey

To grant admin access run:

    groupmems -g wheel -a unikey

## Security Note

If someone you've granted access revokes your access, you can always destroy
the VM in the [SDDC Portal](https://sddcportal.sydney.edu.au/vcac/org/pers/).
